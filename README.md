About Project
-------------
1) In this project i imported the collection of schools and some of its data like its board, ratings, location and some extra curricular activities in a single dashboard screen.
2) by using these information the parents can easily choose the school for their children.
3) And i attached the official schools page in my project so that they can easily know more about the school.
